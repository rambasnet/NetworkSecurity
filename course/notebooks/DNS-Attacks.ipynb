    "- Domain Name Service (DNS) is a system that translates domain names to IP addresses\n",
    "- DNS is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network\n",
    "- DNS is a key component of the Internet\n",
    "- DNS is a client-server network communication system\n",
    "- DNS is a distributed database that contains records for each domain name\n",
    "- Due its importance, DNS is a common target for cyber attacks\n",
    "    - DNS Spoofing, DNS Hijacking, DNS Amplification, DNS Flooding (DoS), DNS cache poisoning, etc.\n",
    "- E.g. `www.google.com` is translated to `142.250.191.46` according to [https://www.nslookup.io/domains/google.com/webservers/](https://www.nslookup.io/domains/google.com/webservers/)\n",

    "## DNS Hierarchical Structure, Zones and Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Humans can remember domain names, but computers need IP addresses\n",
    "- DNS is a hierarchical system that starts from the root domain and goes down to the top-level domain (TLD), second-level domain, subdomain, etc.\n",
    "- Each domain is a zone and has a DNS server that is responsible for that zone\n",
    "- DNS servers are classified as:\n",
    "    - Root Servers: Servers that are responsible for the root zone (.)\n",
    "    - TLD Servers: Servers that are responsible for the top-level domain zone\n",
    "        - E.g. `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.gov`, `.edu`, `.uk`, `.fr`, `.de`, `.jp`, `.cn`, `.ru`, etc.\n",
    "    - Second-level Servers: Servers that are responsible for a specific domain zone\n",
    "        - E.g. `google.com`, `facebook.com`, `twitter.com`, `amazon.com`, etc.\n",
    "- the official list of all the TLDs is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)\n",
    "- The root servers are managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)\n",
    "- The root servers are distributed around the world and are managed by different organizations\n",
    "- The root servers are the entry point to the DNS system\n",
    "- TLDs are managed by \"designated organizations\" or \"sponsored organizations\"\n",
    "    - E.g. `.com` is managed by Verisign, `.org` is managed by Public Interest Registry, etc.\n",
    "    - .gov is managed by the General Services Administration (GSA), .edu is managed by Educause, etc.\n",
    "- Second-level domains are managed by the organization that owns the domain\n",
    "- when a domain name is purchased, the TLD's designated managers add the information to the corresponding registry databases\n",
    "    - GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, Tcows, eNom, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DNS Zones\n",
    "\n",
    "- A DNS zone is a portion of the DNS namespace that is managed by a specific organization or administrator\n",
    "- A zone may have manage one or more subdomains for a specific domain\n",
    "- a multinational company may have multiple zones for each country\n",
    "    - e.g., `us.company.com`, `uk.company.com`, `fr.company.com`, `de.company.com`, etc.\n",
    "- each zone has a zone file that stores DNS records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of DNS Zones\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primary Zone\n",
    "\n",
    "- holds the original read-write copy of the zone file.\n",
    "- changes to DNS records (like adding new subdomains or IPs) are made here.\n",
    "- Example: The authoritative DNS server for example.com holds the primary zone file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Secondary Zone\n",
    "\n",
    "- read-only copy of the primary zone.\n",
    "- updated from the primary zone via zone transfers (AXFR or IXFR).\n",
    "- used for **redundancy** and **load balancing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stub Zone\n",
    "\n",
    "- contains only essential records (like NS and SOA) to identify the authoritative servers for another zone.\n",
    "- used for delegation and resolving dependencies between zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward Zone\n",
    "\n",
    "- maps domain names → IP addresses.\n",
    "- Example: example.com → 93.184.216.34\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reverse Zone\n",
    "\n",
    "- maps IP addresses → domain names.\n",
    "- Example: 93.184.216.34 → example.com\n",

    "2. The local DNS server checks its cache for the domain name\n",
    "3. If the domain name is not in the cache, the local DNS server sends a query to the root server\n",
    "4. The root server doesn't know the IP address, it responds with the IP address of the TLD server\n",
    "5. The local DNS server sends a query to the TLD server (.net)\n",
    "6. If the TLD server doesn't know the IP address, it responds with the IP address of the second-level server (company.net)\n",

    "\n",
    "- dns-server-53 container at 10.9.0.53 is the DNS server for our experimental setup\n",
