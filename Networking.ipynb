    "# Networking\n",
    "\n",
    "- computer networks are so ubiquitous that they're taken for granted\n",
    "- we're constantly connected to Internet and use applications that rely on networking\n",
    "    - email, social media, the Web\n",
    "- these applications rely on a particular network protocol, but each protocol uses the same general network transport methods\n",
    "- there are vulnerabilities in the networking protocols themselves and on systems and applications running on the network\n",
    "\n",
    "## OSI Model\n",
    "- Open Systems Interconnection model\n",
    "- governs the language used by systems in the network to talk to each other\n",
    "- the structure of the language is described in 7 layers by the OSI model\n",
    "- the conceptual layers make it easier for different network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) and applications (Web, email) to focus on their respective layers and ignore the others\n",
    "\n",
    "### OSI layers\n",
    "<img src=\"./resources/OSIModel.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Physical layer** \n",
    "    - lowest layer that deals with the physical connection between two points\n",
    "    - responsible for activating, maintaining, and deactivating these bit-stream communications\n",
    "    - Ethernet card and cable, WiFi Card belong to this layer\n",
    "- **Data-link layer**\n",
    "    - deals with transferring data providing high-level functions (error correction and flow control)\n",
    "    - provides procedures for activating, maintaining, and deactivating data-link connections\n",
    "    - ARP (Address Resoultion Protocol) is a common protocol that uses this layer\n",
    "    - Ehternet switches are network devices that use Layer 2 protocol\n",
    "- **Network layer**\n",
    "    - works as the middle ground\n",
    "    - primarily role is to pass information between the lower and the higher layers\n",
    "    - provides addressing (IP) and routing between two different networks\n",
    "    - most routers and layer-3 switches are primarily use this layer\n",
    "- **Transport layer**\n",
    "    - provides transparent transfer of data between systems\n",
    "    - provides reliable data communication, so the higher layers do not have to worry about reliability or cost-effectiveness of data transmission\n",
    "    - TCP, UDP and ICMP are commonly used protocols of this layer\n",
    "- **Session layer**\n",
    "    - responsible for establishing and maintaining connections between network applications\n",
    "- **Presentation layer**\n",
    "    - responsible for presenting the data to applications in a syntax or language they understand\n",
    "    - supports things like encryptiong, data compressions, image file (GIF, JPG) etc.\n",
    "- **Application layer**\n",
    "    - the layer users interact with\n",
    "    - concerned with keeping track of the requirements of the application\n",
    "    - HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SSH, Telnet are some protocols used in this layer\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Packet Encapsulation\n",
    "- starting from the application layer, the packet wraps the presentation layer around the data, which wraps the session layer, which wraps the transport layer, and so forth\n",
    "<img src=\"./resources/PacketEncapsulation.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sockets\n",
    " - standard way to perform network communications through the OS\n",
    " - socket API takes care of OSI details\n",
    " - in C, sockets behave a lot like files where you use read() and write() to receive and send data\n",
    " - /usr/includesys/sockets.h provide a bunch of functions to work with sockets\n",
    " - socket(), connect(), bind(), listen(), accept(), send(), recv()\n",
    " - we'll use Scapy python library to create packets with various protocol types and send across networks\n",
    "   \n",
    "## IP Address\n",
    "- numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network\n",
    "    - uses Internet Protocol (IP) for routing packets\n",
    "- two types: IPv4 and IPv6\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPv4 (version 4)\n",
    "- uses 32-bit number to represent usually written in 4 quads of decimals : XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX\n",
    "    - e.g. 192.168.1.1\n",
    "- most prevalent\n",
    "- can support upto $2^{32} = 4,294,967,296$ unique addresses\n",
    "- each decimal number (8-bit value) that can range from 0-255\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPv6 (version 6)\n",
    "- uses 64-bit number and the scheme is not quite readable, e.g.: 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public addresses\n",
    "- used by public network and/or devices\n",
    "- routeable over the Internet, publicly accessible unless behind firewall\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private addresses\n",
    "- reserved for internal or private networks to communiate with each other\n",
    "- private IP addresses do not have to unique across networks allowing for IPv4 addresses to not completely deplet\n",
    "- private networks use Network Address Translation (NAT) technique to connect private networks to the the Internet\n",
    "    - Edge router/gateway/proxy server usually does the NAT to route packets from systems in private network to the Internet and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "#### private addresses\n",
    "| Name | CIDR block | Address Range | Number of addresses | Class name |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \n",
    "| 24-bit block | 10.0.0.0/8 | 10.00/0 - 10.255.2555.255 | 16777216\t| Single Class A.|\n",
    "| 20-bit block\t| 172.16.0.0/12\t| 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 | 1048576\t| Contiguous range of 16 Class B blocks.|\n",
    "| 16-bit block\t| 192.168.0.0/16 | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 | 65536 | Contiguous range of 256 Class C blocks.|\n",
    "\n",
    "- most home routers use 16-bit block\n",
    "- mid-sized organization typically use 20-bit block\n",
    "- large institutions like Universities use 24-bit block\n",
